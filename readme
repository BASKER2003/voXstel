## Installation and Usage

1. Install XAMPP on your system.
2. Start the Apache and MySQL servers in XAMPP.
3. Download the project files as a zip folder.
4. Extract the files and place them inside the `htdocs` folder in the XAMPP installation directory.
5. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files and find the `hms.sql` file.
6. Import the `hms.sql` file into your XAMPP database. You can do this by accessing phpMyAdmin through your web browser and selecting the Import option.
7. Once the database is imported successfully, open a web browser and enter the following URL to access the VoXstel application:
http://localhost/<Your_Project_Folder_Name>

Replace `<Your_Project_Folder_Name>` with the name of the folder where you extracted the project files.

Make sure to replace `<Your_Project_Folder_Name>` with the actual name of the folder where you placed the project files inside the `htdocs` folder. This will ensure that users can access the VoXstel application correctly. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!
